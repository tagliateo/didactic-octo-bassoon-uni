# This assignment will assess your skills and knowledge in developing a function through an incremental development process such that the debugging becomes fast. There are two parts of this assignment, and you must submit both parts.

# Part 1
# You work as a software developer in a company that creates custom software solutions for various clients. Your company has been approached by an educational client who wants to develop a function that calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two legs as arguments. Your manager has instructed you to use incremental development to create the necessary function and document each stage of the development process. After completing the final stage of development, you have to test the function with different arguments and record the outputs in your Learning Journal.

import math

def hypotenuse(a, b):
    sqrd = a**2 + b**2
    c = math.sqrt(sqrd)

    return c


print(hypotenuse(3, 4))  # expected output: 5.0
print(hypotenuse(5, 12))  # expected output: 13.0
print(hypotenuse(1, 1))  # expected output: √2.0 (approximately 1.4142135623730951)

print('PART TWO\n')




# Part 2
#  You are a software developer who wants to establish yourself as a skilled and versatile programmer. To achieve this, you have decided to create a work portfolio that showcases your ability to develop custom software solutions. This portfolio will be your gateway to attract potential clients and establish yourself as a freelancer.
# As part of your portfolio, you plan to create your own function that does some useful computation using an incremental development approach that will demonstrate your programming skills and problem-solving abilities. You will document each stage of the development process, including the code and any test input and output in your Programming Assignment.

def averages(num1, num2):
    avg = int(num1 + num2 / 2)
    return avg

print(averages(4, 4))
print(averages(3, 9))
print(averages(10, 500))


# Here's a possible answer:

# I know that my background is in software engineering, and I've had the privilege of working on exciting projects and developing my skills in the field. However, after being laid off twice in the past three years, I've come to realize that job security and stability are just as important to me as personal fulfillment.

# As a software engineer, I've had to adapt to ever-changing technologies and priorities, which can be challenging and unpredictable. While I've enjoyed the technical challenges, I've also experienced the stress and uncertainty that comes with it.

# I'm excited about the opportunity to join IKEA as a Customer Service Associate because it offers a sense of stability and routine that I'm craving right now. As a Customer Service Associate, I'll have the opportunity to work in a fast-paced environment that values teamwork and customer satisfaction. I'm drawn to IKEA's commitment to people and planet, and I believe that my analytical skills and problem-solving abilities will be valuable assets in this role.

# Additionally, I'm looking for a role that allows me to connect with people on a daily basis and make a positive impact on their day. As a software engineer, I often worked remotely or in isolation, which can be isolating. I'm excited about the prospect of working in a physical store, interacting with customers face-to-face, and being part of a team that prioritizes collaboration and communication.

# I'm not naive to the fact that my background is unconventional for this role, but I believe that my transferable skills – such as attention to detail, problem-solving, and communication – will be valuable in this position. I'm eager to learn new skills and take on new challenges in this role, and I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my unique perspective and skills to IKEA's customer service team."

# This answer acknowledges your non-traditional background for the role while highlighting your relevant transferable skills and motivations for joining IKEA. By showing enthusiasm for the company culture and values, you demonstrate your ability to adapt to new environments and roles. Remember to be honest about your situation and highlight your strengths while downplaying any perceived weaknesses.
