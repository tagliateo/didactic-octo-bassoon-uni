Here is a Python program that does what you asked for:
```
# Ask the user for their name
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Display n characters from the left (accept n as input from the user)
n = int(input("Enter the number of characters to display from the left: "))
print(name[:n])

# Count the number of vowels
vowel_count = 0
for char in name:
    if char.lower() in 'aeiou':
        vowel_count += 1
print(f"Number of vowels: {vowel_count}")

# Reverse the name
reversed_name = name[::-1]
print("Reversed name:", reversed_name)

# Here's how the program works:

# 1. The first line asks the user to enter their name.
# 2. The second line asks the user to enter the number of characters to display from the left.
# 3. The third line uses slicing (`name[:n]`) to extract `n` characters from the beginning of the name and prints them.
# 4. The fourth line initializes a variable `vowel_count` to 0 and then loops through each character in the name using a `for` loop. For each character, it checks if it is a vowel (using the `in` operator with a string containing all vowels) and increments `vowel_count` if it is. Finally, it prints the total count of vowels.
# 5. The fifth line uses slicing again, this time with a step of `-1` (`name[::-1]`) to reverse the entire name and prints it.

# Note that this program assumes that the input name is a string. If you want to handle non-string inputs (e.g., numbers or other non-string types), you may need to add additional error handling.
