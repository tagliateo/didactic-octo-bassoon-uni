# in a program, a dictionary contains lists of students and their courses. The teacher is interested to have a dictionary that has the courses as key and the students enrolled in each course as values. Each key has three different values.

# To address this requirement, write a function to invert the dictionary and implement a solution that satisfies the teacherâ€™s need. In particular, the function will need to turn each of the list items into separate keys in the inverted dictionary. Also provide a technical explanation for the code and its output in minimum 200 words.

# Programming Instructions:
# Print the original dictionary as well as the inverted dictionary.
# Include your the Python program and the output in your submission.
# The code and its output must be explained technically. The explanation can be provided before or after the code, or in the form of comments within the code.
